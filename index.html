              Soma Cruz (来須 蒼真 Kurusu Sōma?, Sōma Kurusu) is the protagonist
              from the games Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Castlevania: Dawn
              of Sorrow. He also appears in the cross-over games Castlevania:
              Harmony of Despair and Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soma has a wide range of powers and abilities called 'souls' which
              are categorized as offensive, defensive, or tactical. He acquires
              these abilities through his "power of dominance" - the power to
              control and summon the souls of defeated monsters. This is a
              derivation of Dracula's primary power, the ability to command
              monsters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soma fights with a variety of weapons, including swords, spears,
              and axes. Many of his weapons are references to mythology and
              folklore, such as the Valmanway, Longinus, Excalibur, or Claimh
              Solais (even Death's Scythe). The whip sword is a reference to the
              Castlevania series' tradition of whips as primary weapons, but is
              the only weapon in Aria of Sorrow that resembles a whip. Soma can
              also use handguns, a Rocket Propelled Grenade, and a Positron
              Rifle, in an interesting (and futuristic) departure from other
              games in the Castlevania series.
